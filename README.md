# Netflix Movie EDA ðŸŽ¬

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of Netflix movies to uncover insights about genres, popularity, and trends. It uses **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for data analysis and visualization.

---

## Project Overview

- Dataset contains **9,827 movies** with **9 columns**.
- Key preprocessing steps:
  - Handled missing/duplicate values (none found).
  - Converted `release_date` to datetime and extracted **year**.
  - Dropped unnecessary columns (`original_lang`, `poster_url`).
  - Processed `Genre` column (comma-separated values cleaned and split).
  - Handled outliers in `popularity`.
  - Categorized `vote_average` into groups:
    - **Popular**
    - **Average**
    - **Below Average**
    - **Not Popular**
